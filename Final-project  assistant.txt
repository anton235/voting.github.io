Likud
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - fighting a second re-election campaign under the shadow of
pending corruption indictments, moved early to reinforce Likud by merging it with Finance Minister Moshe
Kahlon’s party giving himself one less party to wrestle with in governing coalition negotiations. Later in the
race, he convinced Moshe Feiglin, leader of the far-right Zehut party, to pull out of the elections in order to
give larger right-wing parties the precious votes he was taking. In exchange, Feiglin was promised a ministry in
a future Likud-led government.

Kahol Lavan 
The largest of the multi-party players in the race, Kahol Lavan has continued with its four man
alliance formed ahead of the April election. This “brotherhood” of centrist parties features Yair Lapid’s Yesh
Atid and new parties headed by two former IDF chiefs of staff — Benny Gantz and Moshe Ya’alon, who
previously served as defense minister under Netanyahu. Many predicted that the three-way marriage
wouldn’t last past the April election, but the parties are still together.

Yamina
renamed mid-campaign from the “United Right” slate is essentially a restoration of the
alliance Ayelet Shaked helped dismantle. After a relatively weak showing in April elections , the religious
parties they left behind — Habayit Hayehudi and Bezalel Smotrich's National Union, agreed, as did Bennett, to
fall in line behind Shaked.

Reshima Meshutefet
After a split in the former elections - the four ideologically disparate parties have decided to
unite once more to re-energize their community. The slate’s leader, Ayman Odeh, has expressed hope that
the move will help.

Yisrael Beiteinu
Avigdor Lieberman played his political cards cleverly when he refused to join Netanyahu’s
coalition after April’s election, thus triggering the September ballot. Once a hard-right sectoral party for
immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Lieberman has made his central campaign promise the formation
of a government that will not include the ultra-Orthodox - presumably with Likud and Kahol Lavan.

United Torah Judaism
The Ashkenazi, ultra-Orthodox alliance comprised of Agudat Yisrael and Degel
Hatorah, hopes to recreate its strong showing in the April election - or perhaps surpass it.

Shas
Like its Ashkenazi counterpart, the Mizrahi ultra-Orthodox party is confident that things can only
improve for them in the do-over election — though some polls suggest otherwise.

Labor-Gesher
In the first Israeli election of 2019 held in April, Labor was hobbled by the leadership of
problematic outsider Avi Gabbay. He has since been replaced by former party head Amir Peretz, but there’s a
new problem. Instead of succumbing to pressure to join forces with the leftist Meretz Party, Peretz decided to
appeal to the center-right by teaming up with Orli Levi-Abekasis’ Gesher party. One popular member of Labor,
Stav Shaffir, was discontent enough to jump ship, joining Meretz and Barak in the new Democratic Union.

Democratic Union
 Among the wave of alliances in Israeli politics, this new electoral pact has been perhaps
the oddest. It was born after former Prime Minister Ehud Barak thundered back onto the political scene in
May, burning with desire to unite the nation’s center-left and leftist parties into one. And although he didn’t
declare as much, he implied that he’d like to see himself leading the charge.
